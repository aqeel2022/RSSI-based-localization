Abstract of the Paper: 
=============================================================================================================
Location information is critical in Wireless Sensor Networks(WSNs) used for the purpose of monitoring. Catastrophe can occur due to system failure and lack of location information of failure point. Many localization approaches are proposed by authors which use different methods of finding the distance between nodes and by manipulating the distances,the nodes' location is estimated.In this paper we have presented analysis of a unique approach based on combination of existing work which uses Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values for distance estimation with trilateration and centroid positioning systems.The algorithm is coded in C++ programming language and tested using the hardware measurements on IRIS motes.The path loss exponent was calculated to be 2.4. The evaluation of the given localization algorithm is done on the basis of performance with regard to localization error and number of anchor nodes. The simulation results prove that trilateration is a better positioning system than centroid.
